<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>Like a homemade cocktail gone wrong, alcohol and the immune system make a sour mix. <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20983-too-much-booze-blunts-your-immune-system/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>Studies</a> show that consuming four or five drinks a day for one week makes white blood cells produce a whopping 75% less virus-fighting signal molecules than normal. When these signals don’t work effectively, cells have little chance of eliminating a virus, and nothing makes us more unpopular than turning up to a party with the flu.</p>
<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>And the bad influence of alcohol doesn’t end there; it also gives our gut a hard time by altering its <a href="https://www.insider.com/does-alcohol-weaken-the-immune-system" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>microbiome</a>. This collection of bacteria, viruses and other genetic material in the GI tract give the immune system essential support, making it crucial for good health. On top of that, alcohol washes away immune cells in the digestive system, making us miss out on social fun thanks to the sniffles.</p>
<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>With this in mind, it’s not surprising that experts recommend shunning alcohol when we’re already feeling unwell. Just like our innate immune system, our <a href="https://www.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/brochures-and-fact-sheets/hangovers#chapter07" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>adaptive immune</a> system — which gets to work when we’re sick — is slowed down by alcohol.</p>

<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>Giving up alcohol also improves sleep, which plays a vital part in our overall health and makes our <a href="https://www.healthline.com/health-news/not-sleeping-may-make-social-life-a-snooze" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>social life</a> more fun. When we <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/insomnia/expert-answers/lack-of-sleep/faq-20057757" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>sleep</a>, our immune system is hard at work releasing proteins our bodies need to fight infections and inflammation. So when our sleep is disrupted, we’re more likely to get sick or feel too tired to hit the town for an enjoyable weekend.</p>
<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>When it comes to diet, alcohol and the immune system are at odds again. Alcohol causes blood sugar to rise and fall suddenly, causing us to seek out unhealthy fatty food that’s rich in carbohydrates. Our immune system sees junk food as a <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/this-is-what-fast-food-does-to-your-immune-system-2018-1" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>harmful invader</a> and goes into overdrive to fight against it. Having a hard-working immune system may sound like a good thing, but it can lead to preventable ailments like diabetes.</p>
