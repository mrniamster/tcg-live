The same applies for restaurant and hotel suppliers and the entire supply chain. As a premium water producer catering to fine hotels and restaurants around the world, VEEN has been a part of this chain since 2007. Seeing its business brought to standstill in February 2020, the last six months have been a reflective time for the team. VEEN Scene caught up with Aman Gupta, Managing Director of VEEN, just as he & his team are beginning to see results of their change strategy, announcing the launch of Zero Percent Shop – a mindful lifestyle destination for online shopping, trade and wholesale distribution.</em></p>

<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>The last 12 months have been a path of “redefining” for VEEN.  Our team has been asking us to develop a bigger portfolio of brands, have online shopping presence and take steps into retail from our core sales channel which is HORECA.  This and my own personal journey towards many changes in my own lifestyle led to the idea of Zero Percent, the new vertical that we are launching within the group.</p>

<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>Indeed we were and the pandemic certainly did accelerate this path.  We have been badly affected by the virus like almost all our dear customers and accelerating the “redefining” path of our business was the only chance we had facing us.  I strongly believe that we have identified a strong path for business in the post COVID world – one that can make a difference, has a purpose and is the need of the hour.</p>

<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>We have recently created a new Group level company, called Third Culture Group for all our businesses.

<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>We believe that the future of food and beverage consumption has to be around mindful consumption and incorporating a mindful lifestyle is key to this.  We have created the Zero Percent Shop to become the “go to” platform for the mindful lifestyle focusing on a unique selection of curated food and beverage brands in the categories of 0% alcohol, 0% dairy, 0% pesticides, 0% sugar, 0% microplastic, Fine Water and 0% meat.</p>
<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>We want to help consumers drink less alcohol, consume less sugar and consume more organic, eat less meat and consume healthier in order to be happier.</p>

<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>Indeed they do – more and more people are ditching alcohol, plant based dairy is becoming very popular, consumers want more organic products, people understand the ill-effects of sugar, and reducing our meat intake as a planet is the only way forward.  All these things are happening and more and more consumers want brands catering to these lifestyle changes that it is easier for them to make these changes.  We felt that bringing all the categories together in one platform is what could make a difference not only for consumers but also for small and medium sized producers like ourselves to have a common online/offline platform to showcase our brands.</p>
