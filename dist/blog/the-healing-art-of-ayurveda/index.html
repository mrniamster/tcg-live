<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>Although the healing science of Ayurveda is well known in its homeland of India, the ancient holistic system has yet to go fully mainstream in other parts of the world. But that may soon change, as there are strong signs that 2020 could be the year of Ayurveda.</p>
<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>In the past few months alone, Ayurveda has graced the headlines of media ranging from style bible Vogue to quality British newspapers such as the <em data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>Guardian and the Daily Telegraph</em>, and the cosmopolitan globetrotter’s digest <em data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>Condé Nast Traveller</em>.</p>

<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>There are many ways that the 5,000-year-old health system can help to address the challenges of modern living.</p>
<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a><em data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>“Ayurveda, a Sanskrit word which literally translates as the science of life, has universally applicable principles,”</em> says Ayurveda practitioner and expert Urvashi Naithani, who is based in Dehradun, the capital of the Indian state of Uttarakhand which is nestled near the Himalayan foothills.</p>
<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a><em data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>“Ayurveda caters to each individual’s daily existence. It takes a holistic view of health, encompassing a balanced diet, healthy lifestyle, physical fitness, mental, social, and spiritual wellbeing for a disease-free, long and healthy life,”</em> explains Naithani, who has also consulted with VEEN on their line of <a href="https://ayurvedawater.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>Ayurveda Water</a> and <a href="http://ayurvedasupershot.com/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>Ayurveda Super Shots</a>.</p>
<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>“Water is a basic drink and a necessity,” she says. “In today’s fast-paced life, when you need to be ahead of the game, a quick source of goodness of herbs on-the-go is provided through Ayurveda waters and super shots,” she says. “There’s only one healing force in the universe and that’s nature. Our role is to facilitate and promote this process of healing with the help of pure goodness that nature has in abundance, extracted in these shots and drinks,” says Naithani.</p>
<div class="text-center" class="bannerComp" data-v-7371192a data-v-2e84942a><img srcset="/_nuxt/img/7eeb1ee-640.jpeg 640w,/_nuxt/img/908122a-800.jpeg 800w,/_nuxt/img/a39dd32-853.jpeg 853w" class="img-fluid" data-v-7371192a> <div class="gallery-text" data-v-7371192a><h1 data-v-7371192a></h1></div></div>
<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>Our modern, fast-paced lives are increasingly having a negative impact on our physical, mental, social and spiritual wellbeing, according to Naithani. That negative impact is manifesting itself in symptoms such as stress, burnout, anxiety, and depression.</p>
<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a><em data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>“Ayurveda takes an individualised approach and doesn’t follow the theory of ‘one size fits all,’”</em> she says. <em data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>“It encourages you to discover your individual needs, as well as grow, heal and reflect on your life in the most tailored way possible. Ayurveda does not focus on symptoms but addresses the root cause. When you know what’s causing you to feel out of balance, you can simply refer to the suggested foods to eat or avoid, and lifestyle regimes to follow or avoid according to your dosha to restore balance.”</em></p>
<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>In Ayurveda, there are three doshas or energies present in the body: vata (air and space), pitta (fire and water), and kapha (earth and water).  Though a person may have a combination of doshas, which are derived from the five elements, usually one or two are prevalent. The proportion of each dosha may change over time due to environment, age, and diet, for example.</p>
<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>A person with a kapha dosha often has their feet firmly planted on the ground. Physically strong, they are often emotionally stable, patient, and calm. Yet they are prone to weight gain and feeling sluggish at times.</p>
<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>The recommended diet for a kapha type includes fruits such as apples and grains like rye, barley, and buckwheat and the recommendation of minimising oils and fats. Those who are kapha type should favour light, warm foods.</p>

<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>Traditional medicine is witnessing resurgence in popularity, in part due to globalisation, says Naithani, who comes from a family of allopathic doctors. She believes this is a positive direction, as the ancient Indian healing system can offer something for everyone.</p>
<p data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a><em data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>“I strongly believe that principles of Ayurveda should become part of the education system. Ayurveda is a lifestyle – a way of living and being. Today, we see a lot of lifestyle issues even in children, and by the time they are adults those issues have already taken a toll on their health. Through Ayurveda we can sow the seeds of physical, mental, social, and spiritual wellbeing right from childhood,”</em> she says, adding, <em data-v-2e84942a data-v-2e84942a>“Ayurveda can provide a strong, nurturing foundation that can lead to wisdom and growth and a brighter future for our youth.”</em></p></div> <hr data-v-2e84942a> <div class="read-more" data-v-2e84942a><h1 class="p18h text-center" data-v-2e84942a>RELATED STORIES</h1> <div class="d-flex justify-content-between" data-v-ec02b258 data-v-2e84942a><div class="prev" data-v-ec02b258><img width="100px" srcset="/_nuxt/img/550f209-640.jpg 640w,/_nuxt/img/9fb87e2-800.jpg 800w,/_nuxt/img/f0c3707-960.jpg 960w,/_nuxt/img/00d000f-1120.jpg 1120w,/_nuxt/img/2b05393-1280.jpg 1280w,/_nuxt/img/fca13fc-1440.jpg 1440w" alt style="display:block" data-v-ec02b258> <a href="/blog/giving-up-alcohol" class="font-bold p18" data-v-ec02b258>
