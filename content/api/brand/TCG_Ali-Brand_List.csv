ISH Spirits,"Based in Copenhagen, Denmark, ISH Spirits were created by Morten Sørensen as part of his 100-day alcohol-free challenge. ISH is this alternative for the mindful drinker - the athlete, the pregnant woman, or the designated driver. It’s for those who can tear up the dance floor sober, and for those who simply want to wake up with a clear head on a Sunday morning. Realizing people craved the same familiar flavours, ISH was created, so that we can all still enjoy our favourite cocktails with no-and-low-alcohol, for any occasion, and most importantly – without compromise.",https://ishspirits.com/,ish.png
Uwe,"Uwe is the first German craft beer brand to only sell non-alcoholic beers. Behind it are three friends from Hamburg: Laia, Sönke and Philip. Uwe started at the beginning of May 2018.

Our goal: non-alcoholic craft beer that is made with the same passion that other brewers reserve for alcoholic beverages. We want you to finally be able to confidently drink non-alcoholic beer. Without making an ape.",https://www.drinkuwe.com/,uwe.jpg
